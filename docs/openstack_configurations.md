# Additional OpenStack related configuration options

Depending on you OpenStack configuration, you might need additional configuration options for the validator to run. Note that all of these settings need to be done similarly for BOSH once you deploy a Director or Cloud Foundry.

## Using self-signed certificates

You can add your certificate chain in the property `openstack.connection_options.ca_cert`. Read more on the topic at [bosh.io](http://bosh.io/docs/openstack-self-signed-endpoints.html).

## Using boot disks from block storage instead of hypervisor-local storage

By default, hypervisor-local storage is used for a VMs boot disk. If your OpenStack setup requires you to use disks from block storage instead, you can set `openstack.boot_from_volume: true`.

## Using flavors with 0 root disk size

By default, the size of the boot disk is determined by the root disk size of the flavor you are using. If you're using flavors with a root disk size of 0, you need to specify the desired root disk size in `cloud_config.vm_types.['default'].cloud_properties.root_disk`. We recommend a minimum size of 10GB.

## Using internal ntp servers

By default, the validator uses an external ntp server from pool.ntp.org. If your OpenStack installation cannot access external ntp servers, e.g. firewall restrictions, you need to specify an internal ntp server in the property `validator.ntp`. Working time synchronization is necessary for many security concepts, such as token expiration time.

## Using config-drive instead of metadata service

By default, the VMs created try to receive data from OpenStack's HTTP metadata service. If your OpenStack installation doesn't provide medata and userdata over HTTP, but requires you to a config-drive instead, you need to specify this in the property `openstack.config_drive: cdrom`

## Using nova-networking

By default, the OpenStack uses neutron for networking since version 28. If you require nova-networking, switch on `openstack.use_nova_networking: true` to turn on compatibility mode in the CPI. Be aware that future OpenStack versions will remove this API at some point. See [documentation on bosh.io](http://bosh.io/docs/openstack-nova-networking.html) for additional information.

## Ignoring server availability zones

BOSH will attempt to create volumes in a Cinder availability zone with the same name as the availability zone of the server that the volume is being created for. If your Cinder and Nova availability zones do not have symmetrical names, this will lead to volume creation failures.

The OpenStack Validator will fail the `Your OpenStack using the CPI can create a disk in same AZ as VM` spec with an error message similar to `OpenStack API Bad Request (Invalid input received: Availability zone 'nova-zone' is invalid)`.

BOSH can be told to ignore server availability zones by setting the `ignore_server_availability_zone` CPI property to `false`; the OpenStack Validator will pass this setting through if configured in `validator.yml` as `openstack.ignore_server_availability_zone: false`.
